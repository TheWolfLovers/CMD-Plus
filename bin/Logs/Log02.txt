Diary #1

25/10/2024 | 5:41 PM
Only recently did i find CMD+ again!
And I am glad I still have this thing! It's a wonderful project
Just imagine using it as a alternative for Command Prompt (wouldn't reccomeand)
I even made an icon for it and everything!
I may publish CMD+ to GameJolt at some point too :D
I just wanna get a good amount of stuff working before I do publish it tho

On an unrelated note I forgot that I made Diary #0 entirely like damn XD
So I'm continueing the trend, and maybe even keeping these entires inside the installs of CMD+ people get
speaking of installing I wanna know how to make an exe file essentially unzip CMD+ into different directories
but for GameJolt ima keep it extracted (mainly so people can just run it from Library lol)

By the way:

 [/> = Text input (any string)
 (/> = Number Input
 {/> = Choice input (could be number or specific string)

My codes for inputs :P
