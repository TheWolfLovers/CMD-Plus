Monday 23 December 2024 - Discord [PSO]

Today we got raided by a load of people who joined the PSO. Seer was quick to react as i was deleting messsages.
Gabe joined the battle soon after, and even paused invites to the server (which i broke to let Umby in*)
It was hell, but short lived. It was bitchy tho.
