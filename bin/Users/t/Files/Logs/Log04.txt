Windows VS Linux - Winsound VS VLC

(I should improve the log writing at somepoint bruh)
Anyway, 23/05/2025.

I have added a native support for music!!!
However, it uses VLC, and because I was running it on linux I didn't see a problem.
But, when I transferred over to my pc (via github), I found out I couldn't even use VLC
Stupid VLC LIB AAAAAAAAAA

Anyway, to comprimise I've decided I'm just gonna use winsound if windows, and drop MP3 support. :/

Sorry
