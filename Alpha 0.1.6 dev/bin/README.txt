Hey! Thanks for using the CMD+ command prompt, although currently at Alpha 0.1.4 it's only really for fun, however there is this one thing i need to inform you of

There may be updates by people that are rigged, I am the only on making this program so only I can update it, nonetheless if you accidentally updated CMD+ using a rigged update file, The program backs itself up incase of this, even if there isnt already a backup file.

You want to run CMD+.BACKUP.py and sign in as usual, but you want to enter the command 'restore', because it takes the code from the CMD+.BACKUP.py into a cached .json file which then restores CMD+.py, which is the best failsafe I have.

Thanks for reading
